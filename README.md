A TypeSafe, modern query language compatible with SQL, designed for building applications across various environments.

# Project Overview

Welcome to the nsql project! ðŸš€

Our goal is to create a secure, modern, and readable SQL-compatible language. With nsql, you can write complex queries effortlessly, enjoy type checking to avoid runtime errors, and benefit from multi-language support. Join us in making SQL queries more powerful and maintainable! ðŸ’ª



## Goals
1. **Secure and Modern Syntax**: Provide a SQL-compatible language with a secure and modern syntax, including type checking to eliminate runtime errors.
2. **Enhance Readability**: Improve the readability and maintainability of SQL queries.
3. **Support Complex Queries**: Enable the creation of complex queries with ease, including joins, subqueries, and more, with expressiveness comparable to SQL, as much as possible.
4. **Multi-language Support**: Ensure that nsql can be ported to various programming languages and databases, allowing developers to utilize nsql in different environments, to make the knowledge of nsql applicable everywhere.
